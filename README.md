# Travel - Analyse, Discover, Reignite

**Advanced Data Science project - University of Udine - Tomasetig Biagio - 142141**

The files for the Advanced Data Science project may be found in this repository.

The datasets include:
- my own GNSS coordinate recordings;
- datasets from other research projects (i.e., [Cabspotting](http://cabspotting.org), [T-Drive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/t-drive-trajectory-data-sample/), [Brightkite](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-brightkite.html), [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html), and other data from smaller projects);
- survey results from a questionaree about the relationship between travel and social networks.

The project's purpose is to figure out which concepts are the best for analyzing geographical coordinates, with the goal of adopting these findings into a future social networkÂ app.

The main two files are contained in the .zip folders, namely [travel_presentation.zip](./travel_presentation.zip) and [travel_analysis.zip](travel_analysis.zip), are stored in the .zip folders and contain the markup of the markdown files [travel_presentation.Rmd](./travel_presentation.Rmd) and [travel_analysis.Rmd](./travel_analysis.Rmd), respectively.
This files are important, since some of the original observations contained in the dataset was trimmed for privacy concerns. Therefore the results based on the files contained in [personal_dataset](./objects/personal_dataset) might differ from the actual analysis.
